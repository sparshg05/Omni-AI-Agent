# Omni AI Agent Documentation

## 🌟 Overview
Omni is not just another chatbot—it's an autonomous AI agent that can:  

🔍 Search the web in real-time using Tavily API  
🎬 Provide movie recommendations using TMDB API  
🧠 Make intelligent decisions about which tools to use  
🔗 Chain multiple tools together for complex queries  
💾 Maintain persistent conversation history  
🔄 Adapt its strategy based on results  

What Makes It Special?  
Unlike traditional chatbots that simply respond to questions, Omni uses LangGraph's ReAct pattern to:  

1. Reason about the user's query  
2. Decide which tools to use autonomously  
3. Act by calling appropriate APIs  
4. Observe the results  
5. Repeat if more information is needed  

This creates a truly autonomous agent that can handle complex, multi-step tasks without hardcoded logic.
